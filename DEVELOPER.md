# Developer Information

## Try Examples ##

### Get Credentials ###

Get a free Cloud of Things demo account at [http://m2m.telekom.com/our-offering/cloud-of-things/](http://m2m.telekom.com/our-offering/cloud-of-things/).

Export your Cloud of Things credentials as environment variables. These are required by the examples:

    export COT_REST_CLIENT_HOST="your-host"
    export COT_REST_CLIENT_TENANT="your-tenant"
    export COT_REST_CLIENT_USER="your-user"
    export COT_REST_CLIENT_PASSWORD="your-password"

### Compiling ###

Compile the CoT REST SDK and install it into your local maven repository:

    mvn clean install --activate-profiles build-archives -DskipITs -DskipTests -Dgpg.skip

Compile the example classes and their dependencies:

     mvn --activate-profiles build-archives -f examples/pom.xml package

### Executing Examples ###

Create a new device named ``try-examples``:

    java -cp examples/target/java-rest-client-examples-with-dependencies-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar DeviceCreator --create try-examples

This generates output that contains the ID of the new device, e.g.:

    The new device 'try-examples' has the ID 199332

Remember the ID of the device, it will be needed to trigger an alarm.

Show all devices that are registered in the Cloud of Things:

    java -cp examples/target/java-rest-client-examples-with-dependencies-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar InventoryPrinter

The created device should show up there.

Start an alarm watcher:

    java -cp examples/target/java-rest-client-examples-with-dependencies-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar AlarmWatcher

Trigger an alarm in a new terminal window:

    java -cp examples/target/java-rest-client-examples-with-dependencies-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar AlarmTrigger 199332 my_alarm_identifier CRITICAL "My alarm message."
    
## Run Tests ##

The project uses following kind of tests:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests (file suffix xyz**IT.java**)

Run the unit tests:

    mvn test

Run the integration tests:

    export COT_TEST_CONNECTION_HOST="your-host"
    export COT_TEST_CONNECTION_USER="your-username"
    export COT_TEST_CONNECTION_PASSWORD="your-password"
    export COT_TEST_CONNECTION_TENANT="your-tenant"

    mvn -Dgpg.skip=true integration-test
    
The integration tests require a Cloud of Things account. You must provide the credentials that are used for testing via environment variables before starting the integration tests.

### Run Integration Tests in IntelliJ IDEA ###

To run and debug the integration tests in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), the environment variables must be registered in the *Run Configuration*.

The variables must be registered only once. To do so, choose ``Run`` -> ``Edit Configurations``. Select ``Defaults`` -> ``TestNG`` on the left. Find the line ``Environment Variables`` in the ``JDK Settings`` tab and add the required variables.

Remove the run configurations that have been created before, otherwise the new defaults do not take effect for these. Existing run configurations are shown on the left, above ``Defaults``.


## Build the SDK ##
    
Use the following command to build a jar that contains the SDK and all its dependencies:

    mvn -P build-archives -DskipITs -DskipTests package

## Code Conventions/Style ##

- Write tests
- Keep it simple

### Error Handling ###

In case of errors in communication with Cloud of Things REST API, the 
[``CotSdkException``](src/main/java/com/telekom/m2m/cot/restsdk/util/CotSdkException.java) should be used to wrap the original error or Exception.

An example usage can be found in [``CloudOfThingsRestClient.doRequestWithIdResponse(..)``](src/main/java/com/telekom/m2m/cot/restsdk/CloudOfThingsRestClient.java)
